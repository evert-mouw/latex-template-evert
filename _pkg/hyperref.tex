%% If you are using the hyperref (below), you don't need to load url
%% because it already provides the \url{...} command.
% \usepackage{url}

%% HYPERREF for better URLs, internal references, PDF properties, ...
%% Make sure it comes last of your loaded packages, to give it a fighting chance
%% of not being over-written, since its job is to redefine many LATEX commands.
%% Some interesting options:
%% [bookmarks] a set of PDF bookmarks will be created
%% [bookmarksopen] expand all the PDF bookmark subtrees
%% [hyperindex] attempts to make items in the index by hyperlinked back to the text
%% [unicode] you can use unicode characters in bookmarks
%% [breaklinks] allow links to break over lines
%% [hidelinks] gives you active links in black without a box around them
%% backreferences: DO CURRENTLY NOT WORK, DUNNO WHY NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
%% [backref] inserts extra back links into the bibliography for each entry,
%%  optional values are: section, slide, page, none, or false. If no value is given, section is taken as default.
%%
%% Backend driver if not specified: pdftex / xetex (autodetection),
%% or specify a driver using a package option...
