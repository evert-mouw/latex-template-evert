# Evert's LaTeX template

This is a flexible collection of LaTeX files to help students write papers of articles.

I created the files when I was a student and felt the need for more flexibility.

First have a look at `index.pdf` and then at `index.tex` to get the idea. It includes the `_example` files. The usage of "packages" (`_pkg`) makes it possible to add or remove functionality in a flexible way.

Make sure to enter your personal information in `meta.tex` before compiling your own writing.

I mostly used MikTex under Windows but it (should) work under Linux as well.

Some of the code comments and examples are in Dutch.

Have fun!
